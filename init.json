They are easy to set up, easy to use, small build and beautiful design to not upset the living room atmosphere. But they are also a closed system. In case you are (or becoming) a technical person you may be already hitting against these limitations. This is where the ViCase Gaming PC comes in. It takes the small size and beautiful looks of the Gaming Consoles, but it is an open system, inviting you to expand it in any direction you please. Once you get your ViCase Gaming PC to work, you will be rewarded with significantly better gaming graphics and higher FPS."

Depending on the game you are playing you may experience same speed or it may be noticeably slower. If you play on Ubuntu, you would buy your games on Steam. The biggest draw back is that not all game titles are available on Linux. 2) Windows 10 is the save choice. All titles available and best GPU drivers. Only drawback is that it will set you back $100 US. So you always can start with Ubuntu, invest the $100 into 3 games that play on it and upgrade to Windows 10 later. 3) SteamOS will be a game changer. Pun intended. One day in the future GPUs under SteamOS will have same FPS than under Windows. And all Titles will be available under SteamOS too. Today - however - SteamOS is in beta. It has one thing going for it that is the support of its cool game pad. 4) You can of course install more than one OS and enjoy the different strengths of each."

Heck, even the ATX cables are so big. The ATX cables alone fill the ViCase housing leaving no space for anything else. The solution are Pico ATX Power Supplies. The power supply itself is made tiny by using modern, high efficiency, high density (read expensive) power circuits. And the space consuming cables are done away completely, by soldering the power supply PCB directly to the ATX connector. Problem solved. Unfortunately you now need two Power Supplies: 1) AC/DC Adapter 2) Pico ATX Power aka ViCase-Power. This makes the power supply of the Mini Computer more expensive versus a standard Desktop. In turn you get a much smaller and much more quiet PC."

A specialized PCIe card could accelerate your application > 1000% when compared to your CPU. This makes adding a PCIe Card the most efficient method to speed up your PC. Dedicated PCIe cards can be expensive. This brings us to the second use case of ViDock: Share expensive cards with more than one PC."

The lowest Intel CPU choice is 35 W. But since the Motherboard chip is integrated in AMD AM1 and not integrated in Intel CPUs your power consumption comparison is 12 W versus 48W. Keep in mind though that maximum performance of Entry AMD line is limited to about the performance level of a tablet. In some countries Entry AMD is half the cost for motherboard and CPU when compared to Entry Intel. In other countries the cost is the same. This motherboard directly supports UHD = 4k Display. Only at 30 Hz, but will be sufficient for high end picture frame. Paired with ViCase Tiny you get a Mini or All-In-One PC of lowest cost, lowest power consumption with good looks. Using standard Desktop components will allow you to upgrade only parts when needed and keep it operational for decades to come. The very low power consumption allows for passive cooling and makes this PC practically maintenance free."

Great foundation for a mid range PC, including decent gaming when paired with a GPU. The LGA 1150 CPU socket supports a huge range of intel CPU up to the very fast i7 Quad Core 4790. This means you will have plenty of room to upgrade your CPU later if so desired. You can build computer with this motherboard that will be snappy at everything you throw at them, except for high end demanding applications."

You can even turn off one of the two cores and the whole system will use 6W only at full load. Ideal for a general purpose low cost PC or for a presentation PC, such as a large size 28\" picture frame to replace an A2 printer or presentation displays in meeting rooms, lobby, hotels, etc. The very low power consumption allows the use of a passive cooler, which makes this PC completely maintenance free and literally silent when paired with an SSD. Performance will feel like a decent tablet. Recommended OS Ubuntu. It also may serve as a streaming PC for Gaming or Video. Be aware that in some countries an Intel Celeron CPU is lower cost and at the same time faster."

This CPU will give you a very snappy Office / General Purpose PC. The power budget is still very small with 25W in total, which leads to additional savings in power supply and CPU cooler. Bear in mind that this is the fastest CPU that you can plug into the Entry Motherboard. If you plan on growing the performance of your PC, then you will be better served with the Mid Range Motherboard. But if you are looking for lowest cost, low power consumption HTPC / Office PC, this is the best value — with quite a margin."

This CPU uses the same LGA 1150 socket. This means you can replace this CPU at a later time even with an i5 or i7 Quad Core. Enough room to grow. Pairing the i3 with the GTX-750 will be your entry ticket to the world of high end gaming."

Instead of going all the way to an i7 Quad Core you often get higher performance for your money by investing into a PCIe Add In Card of the type corresponding to your application. The i5-6500 CPU comes with the newly released LGA 1151 socket with the key benefit to support DDR4. DDR4 memory clock starts today at 2133 MHz, versus 1600 MHz of DDR3. Yet you will not see today faster memory transfer rates in real life. This is because the CAS timing is more relaxed as with DDR3 memory. Surely this will change in the future. However, there is one benefit that you can enjoy instantly. DDR4 will allow in an ITX motherboard 32 GB, whereas DDR3 will max out at 16 GB!"

High Profile Modules may collide with the Cooler-L, depending on your Motherboard layout. As always, if you do not want to be troubled with such details, use the Wizard of the V²Configurator. All our ready made configurations using High Profile Memory Modules use the ViCase-Cooler-XL to ensure conflict free assembly for you. Its more expensive design based on heat pipes allows for larger memory modules. To make life simple, all DDR3 memory modules we selected are Low Profile and all DDR4 Modules are High Profile. This makes for straight forward paring: DDR3 with ViCase-Cooler-L and DDR4 with ViCase-Cooler-XL."

If however you want to store large amounts of data, say photos, videos, etc..., then we recommend your Data to be stored on a second HDD for cost reasons. Using RAID 5 technology, you can make HDD quite save and fast.

Desktop drives simply will fail to early, as they are not build for long working hours. Another difference is that desktop drives are designed to be the only disk in a case. The difference is vibration, which will significantly shorten the lifespan of a Disk. RAID drives are designed to higher specs to avoid vibration in the first place and higher class RAID drives even have active vibration cancellation. Also desktop may be recognized as bad even when they are still good when used in a RAID due to different time out standards of desktop drives versus RAID drives. In shorty. do NOT use desktop drives in a RAID. If you are on budget, Western Digital RED are about the same cost as quality desktop drives and they work beautifully in RAID."

An external drive is easiest solution and delivers a lot of safety for little money and effort. These drives are cheap and do not have high durability. As such disconnect them and power them off when not in use. For higher reliability use two drives. Alternate the backup. This way you still have a backup in case something went wrong in the last backup or one of the two drives got damaged or stolen."

This does not bode well that a reliable drive will be inside. Consumer drives that are on all the time fail quite frequently, which is not a good idea for your backup drive. As such we do not recommend the one drive cloud servers, but rather an external drive that is disconnected and powered off when not in use. If you want the convenience of an always on server for backups, then consider a 4 Disk RAID5. It is not cheap, but dramatically more safe."

One step safer is to use a RAID5 system in your workstation -- such as ViCase-Ultra -- and make sequential backups on your NAS. And the highest level of safety is to have two NAS in two locations. So if one location is lost, be it by thief or higher force, then you still have your data safe in another location. A Synologyt NAS is very simple to setup. If your Data is important you should keep it safe. Life happens. Give yourself peace of mind."

                    "(2) Yes means this Display is compatible to ViCase-Stand, which is a $49 luxury All-In-One Converter. It also gives you a keyboard shelf to store your keyboard when not in use or in transport and a carry grip to carry the entire unit of PC + Display + Power Supply + Keyboard.",

                    "(4) IPS is a newer Display technology which allows wider viewing angles. If you frequently use your display with more than one person, it will show a significant difference. If you are the only user you might not see a difference.",
                    "(5) D-Sub connector is used for the old analog VGA connection. The image on the screen will not be as sharp as with digital connection and you might see other distortions. As such, try to avoid to use VGA / D-Sub connection.",
                    "(6) HDMI, DVI, Display port are all digital connectors and all deliver a high quality image to the Display. With the proper cable you can convert one connector to another. Say your motherboard has a DVI connector and your Display has Display Port, then you still can make a connection using a DVI to Display Port cable."
